A memory skill game based on Milton Bradleyâ€™s Simon. The game will play a series of notes that the player must play back. Each time a note is played back successfully, the game will continue to add notes to the existing melody. 

The game ends when the the player is no longer able to play back the melody. Score is measured by how many notes a player is able to succesfully repeat back.
